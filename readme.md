# The calculator

Our first project after leaving the field...  
The project was simple on the surface, **but it wasn't as easy as it looked.**  
The goal was to create a functional calculator.  
We had three days to make it functional.  
## The mission

You can see the statement of the exercise [here](https://github.com/becodeorg/bxl-hopper-1-25/tree/master/The%20Hill/projects/1.calculator).  
This exercise was done during the BeCode web development course.
